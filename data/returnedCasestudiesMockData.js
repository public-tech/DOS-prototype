        answer: "PUBLIC is currently supporting the MOJ to assess challenges relating to vulnerability and reoffending through the Prison Leavers Innovation Challenge (PLIC) Programme. During the discovery phase, PUBLIC interviewed >80 stakeholders in policy, digital and frontline delivery roles across five Departments - including DHSC, MHCLG and MOJ. We engaged with policy teams relating to specific vulnerabilities within the prison cohort, including Race and Ethnicity, Female and Transgender offenders, and elderly offenders. We developed know-how of the broad policy landscape of vulnerability across government bodies and incorporated this knowledge as learning pieces into 6 workshops attended by civil servants.",

        answer: "<p><strong>Context</strong></p><p><strong>PUBLIC worked with</strong> the Welsh Centre for Digital Public Services (CDPS) to design a Digital Strategy for procurement and spend management across the Welsh Government. PUBLIC conducted a mixed-methods user research programme engaging with 100+ end-users of procurement tools (including government, business and third-sector) to understand user needs. We also mapped how upcoming legislative, policy and strategic changes will affect a new Welsh procurement digital strategy. The result was a digital strategy centred on service user-needs which contained actions over a 12, 24 and 48-month time horizon, covering technical specifications for future services, and proposed organizational and staffing changes.</p>",
